# Background:

## Immune Response to *M.tb*:

### Innate Immune Response:

-   First line of defence

-   Alveolar macrophages encounters *M.tb*, phagocytose bacteria, initiates inflammation with release of TNF-⍺ \| IL-1

-   Dendritic cells links the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system by presenting the antigens to the T Lymphocytes

-   Naturally Killer Cells are cytotoxic cells that induce apoptosis of infected macrophages by secreting IFN-γ

### Adaptive Immune Response:

-   T lymphocytes, which is comprised of CD4^+^ & CD8^+^ cells, B lymphocytes

-   CD4^+^ T cells produce IFN-γ \| IL-2 \| TNF-⍺ to active macrophages

-   CD8^+^ T cells destroys *M.tb* infected cells by producing TNF-⍺

-   The role of B cells are being investigated
