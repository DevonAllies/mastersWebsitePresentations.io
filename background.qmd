# Background:

-   TB is a respiratory disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberulosis* (*M.tb*)

-   WHO estimates that 25% of global population is infected with *M.tb*

-   South Africa has a high burden

## Latent TB Infection (LTBI)

-   Definition: An individual that is infected with *M.tb* but has no clinical symptoms of active disease

-   Primary source for new TB cases

-   LTBI -\> Active TB occurs in about 5-10% of infected individuals

-   Factors influencing progression: Weakened Immune system \| Time since infection \| Age

-   Exact mechanism of progression is unknown
